This week we launched a new forum site for the AnyScript community âœ¨ The new
site replaces the old forum which has served the last 10 years as a place for
new and experienced users to get and give help on the AnyBody Modeling System. 




The old forum had served well. Around 10.000 posts and 1800 topics were created
on the old forum since 2009. But the old forum had started to feel a bit old
fashioned and outdated. So it was time to upgrade our community page.

The choice for a new system fell on Discourse.
[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org) is modern forum system which works well
on both desktop and mobile. It has a lot of nice features:

**Conversations and not pages:**

Posts structured by conversations, and not spread across multiple pages where you have to click the next page constantly. Instead, new content loads automatically. Just scroll down.

    <source src="/assets/images/posts/new-forum_scroll.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>


**Effective search:**

Search now works infinitely better than before. Just type in your search terms
to easily find related posts.

There is also options to search individual topics or options to refine the
search to dates, categories, tags, users etc. So now it is much easier to find
the relevant information without having to make a new topic. 


**Nice editor with preview:**

The editor is really nice. It supports a live preview pane, markdown formatting,
math using LaTeX, drag-drop images an much more. Even if you are not familiar
with markdown syntax it is easy to use with the buttons on the toolbar.

## Migration to the new forum system

We migrated all the posts from the old forum and users how had previously posted
on the old forum. Passwords could not be migrated, so you will have to reset
your password the first time you log in. Just click the 'I forgot my password'
link the first time you access the new site.

If you have never used the forum system you will have to create a new user
account. The same is case if you got a new email address or if you just want to
start from scratch.
