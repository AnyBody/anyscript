      We have added a DOI for the AMMR repository. This will help user users 
      communicate which version of the AMMR they are using, and make it easy to 
      cite the AMMR.

[Digital Object Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) (DOIs) are
the foundation of references and metrics in the world of academia. With the release
of AMMR 2.1.1 we have also added a DOI to the AnyBody Managed Model Repository (AMMR):

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1250764.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1250764).

The DOI for the AMMR are issues by [Zenodo](http://about.zenodo.org/), which is
an European Open Science platform hosted at [CERN](https://home.cern/). If you click the link above you will be directed to the side shown below.

### Archived versions

 The DOI above always links to the newest version of the AMMR. That is called a
 concept DOI, and is useful if you want to cite all version of the AMMR.
 However, the AMMR is updated regularly, and we would often like to cite a
 specific version of the AMMR. Luckily, Zenodo [supports DOI versioning](http://blog.zenodo.org/2017/05/30/doi-versioning-launched/), and
 every version of the AMMR has their own DOI.

| Version       |           DOI           |    ReleaseData    |
| ------        | ----------------------- | ----------------- | 
| All versions  | 10.5281/zenodo.125076   |                   |
| AMMR-2.1.1    | 10.5281/zenodo.1287730  | June 12, 2018     |
| AMMR-2.1.0    | 10.5281/zenodo.125127   | March 25, 2018    |
| AMMR-2.0.0    | 10.5281/zenodo.1251274  | November 30, 2017 |
| AMMR-1.6.6    | 10.5281/zenodo.1250765  | March 13, 2017    |

Once a DOI is created [Zenodo](http://about.zenodo.org/) also
archives all the associated files to ensure data is never changed or lost. This effectively means that you can now also
download all [archived versions of the AMMR](https://zenodo.org/record/1287730)
directly from Zenodo.

### Citing the AMMR

DOI's will also help you cite the AMMR and specify exactly which version the AMMR you use. This is really important for scientific publications so others can reproduce your results. The DOI ensures that others can be confident that they get the exact version of the AMMR that you
used. Once a DOI is minted the underlying files can't be changed. So DOIs are
also essential for traceability.

Zenodo will even generate the correct citation style for all journals.

Here is an example of how to cite the AMMR v.2.1.1 for Journal of Biomechanics:
