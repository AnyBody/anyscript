If you have never done musculoskeletal modeling with the [AnyBody Modeling System (AMS)](http://anybodytech.com/) check out the series of short introductory videos below. 
{: .notice--primary}

## How to get the AMMR?

There are different ways to get the AnyBody Managed Model Repository (AMMR).

### Bundled with the AnyBody Modeling System (Recommended)

The AMMR comes bundled with the [AnyBody Modeling System](https://www.anybodytech.com/software/ams/).
This the recommended way to install the AMMR, to ensure compatibility between AMMR and the AnyBody Modeling System. 

**See also:** The [detailed guide](https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/ammr_installation.html) on how install 
the AMMR from AnyBody Modeling system.
{: .notice--info}

### From Zenodo.org

All versions of the AnyBody Managed Model Repository are archived with a DOI. This is useful for 
citing the AMMR, and the DOI's are issued by [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/), which is an
European Open Science platform hosted at CERN.

You can [download all archived versions](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1250764) of the AMMR from
[zenodo.org/communities/anybody](https://zenodo.org/communities/anybody). 


### Development version of the AMMR

{% comment %} The AMMR development version is available on GitHub at
[github.com/AnyBody/AMMR](https://gihub.com/AnyBody/AMMR). Contributions and
pull requests are welcome

The AMMR repository on GitHub is only a mirror of the `main` branch.{% endcomment %}
Development takes place in a closed source-controlled repository to protect
academic contributors who also often need to publish their models before
release. Access to the closed repository is given on request.


## Other resources 

Besides the videos there are a number of valuable resources for helping new and existing users. 

The most important are:

* <a href="https://anyscript.org/tutorials" target="_blank">The AnyBody tutorials.</a>
* <a href="https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc" target="_blank">AMMR documentation</a>
* [Webcasts on the AnyBodyTech Youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFfwPdNH_Wt1O7mQer16JBmax9ImTScMC)

There also one or two PhD courses on musculoskeletal modeling every year in Europe, which use the AnyBody modeling System in the course. The courses are usually hosted by [Aalborg University](http://www.biomechanics.m-tech.aau.dk/) in Denmark and [OTH Regensburg](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/?id=1166) in Germany.
