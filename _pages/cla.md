Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AnyScript Repositories.

The purpose of this Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is to clarify and 
document the rights granted by contributors to AnyBody Technology A/S. 

A CLA is a legal document stating that you are entitled to 
contribute some code/documentation the project and that you are willing 
to have it used in distributions and derivative works. [Read more what a CLA is and why it is necessary](https://www.clahub.com/pages/why_cla)

**Note:** By contributing, your email and name will become an embedded part of the code 
(git version control system), which may be publicly available. This document also 
describes that you waive the right to have your name and email removed or changed 
at a later time, as doing so would be utterly destructive to the project all who 
contribute, utilize and benefit from it.
