We know that you are eager to get started and probably have little patience for long explanations. But before you move on, please pay attention to these two points:

AnyScript.org is a free community and everybody is welcome to contribute. The site is managed jointly by the AnyBody Research Group and AnyBody Technology A/S with the latter sponsoring the expenses.
There are two categories of models available. Both are free but they come with different conditions for use and interaction and it may be important for you to understand and consider these differences.
If you have no more patience, do go ahead and explore. But please come back later and read the rest of this.

## The motivation and history
Models of the human body are very complicated to make. To ensure completeness and credibility we believe that 
the models must be open and that we have to draw on the expertise of many different disciplines and many different 
scientists. For the past decade we have been trying to figure out how this can be organized, and we have not been 
entirely unsuccessful; this site contains the most detailed and validated set of human body models that you are 
likely to find anywhere. And they are all free of charge and open for modifications thanks to the contributions of 
many scientists and the sponsorship of AnyBody Technology A/S.

For about ten years these models were available from Aalborg University's web site and a discussion group was hosted on 
the Yahoo! Groups system. However, in 2008 it was finally decided that a major revision was necessary. The reasons were many:

* The old site did not offer much opportunity for interaction between developers and users and the university web administrators 
did not want to host such facilities for security reasons. 

* The models were being used widely in science and industry, but 
the legal consequences of this had never been considered, and we were beginning to suspect that this policy might be a 
bit naive and even dangerous. 

* As a consequence of the lack of opportunity for interaction support to the model development 
community was done almost exclusively by AnyBody Technology A/S for free and not as it was intended by a community of 
people helping each other.

* The Yahoo group was lacking some of the facilities that we wanted to provide to the users.

* More and more customers requested a tighter integration between the model part and the AnyBody Modeling Software.


It is important to keep this site free but well-functioning web sites are expensive to design and run and it has not 
been possible to raise research funding for this purpose. The solution has been that AnyBody Technology A/S has agreed 
to sponsor the site within their server system and pay for the development of the platform. We can draw on some of the 
web administration technology that was already developed for http://www.anybodytech.com/. It means that there is a joint 
user account system on the two sites, which is really quite natural since the users of the models are almost exclusively 
users of AnyBody Technology A/Sâ€™s products, the AnyBody Modeling System.

## Two parts
Much of this web site is dedicated to uploading and downloading AnyScript models and model snippets, and it is important 
to remember that there are two different license conditions currently represented by two major projects:

1. **AnyBody Model Repository** This collection of models are distributed under very liberal terms named as Self-supported license 
and correspond pretty much to the body repository previously distributed from www.anybody.aau.dk until April 2009. The most 
important issue to consider here is that AnyBody Technology A/S will not put free manpower into helping users of these models 
solve their problems. So in this part of the site, users have to help each other. This part of the repository is for 
non-commercial use only. Detailed terms of use can be found her for upload and download.

2. **AnyBody Managed Model Repository.** This free collection of models is distributed under the terms named Professional license and 
is the model collection in which the professional supporters from AnyBody Technology A/S are investing their efforts. This work 
strives to keep the models well structured and functional, introducing new body parts, making sure that all parts are scalable, 
introducing new applications, introducing new user-friendly output, etc.   Non-commercial users may sometimes obtain support 
from the professional supporters for free when they use these models. However these models have slightly more restrictive conditions 
of which the most important is that AnyBody Technology A/S owns the IPR to these models and only allows you to use them if you 
have a valid license for the AnyBody Modeling System. Detailed terms of use can be found here for upload and download.
3. **Other projects can be defined by community users.** Projects can be used for joint development of models in research groups, etc.
 Such projects can have either the Self-supported license terms or the Professional license terms depending on the origin of 
 the model, scope and project dependencies.

 
The reasoning behind this subdivision is that AnyBody Technology A/S, which is a commercial company and has to make its own 
living, gets something back from the community for its efforts to provide support and well-structured models without getting 
paid for it.

## How to get access 

Most of the content on the new site is public, but if you want do download repositories, post in the forum, etc. it requires you to log in. If you already have a user account on www.anybodytech.com  you are ready to get full benefit of the new site because you can use the same username and password. If you are a new user user you will need to sign up here.

If you choose to log in on www.anyscript.org the user data you have submitted when you registered, more precisely your name and affiliation, will be automatically transferred, and be published if you choose to post in the forum, write in the Wiki or upload files to the Collaboration section.
